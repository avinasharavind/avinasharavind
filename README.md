### Hi! My name is Avinash, and I study the weather and occasionally make cool things related to our atmosphere.

- I'm currently a junior studying Atmospheric Science at Cornell University. 
- I have a particular interest in tropical meteorology, especially tropical cyclones and their predictability.
- I'm also interested in weather-related Data Science and Modeling (I'm minoring in Data Sci and Applied Math).
- I spent the last summer interning at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado looking at hurricane dynamics using high-resolution model data.
- I'm a big F1 fan (Forza Ferrari!)

Not all of my projects are on public repos, but if you're reading this and are interested in hearing about what I've done or seeing my resume, feel free to send me an email at aa2476@cornell.edu!
