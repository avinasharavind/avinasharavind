### Hi! My name is Avinash, and I study the weather and occasionally make cool things related to our atmosphere.

- I'm currently a sophomore studying Atmospheric Science at Cornell University. 
- I have a particular interest in weather-related Data Science and Modeling (I'm minoring in Data Sci and Applied Math). 
- I'm a big F1 fan (Forza Ferrari!)
- Recently have been trying to get into both photography and 3D printing.

Not all of my projects are on public repos, but if you're reading this and are interested in what I've done, feel free to send me an email at aa2476@cornell.edu!
